DataCapture allows the dynamic creation of Forms.  An Administrator will be able to create several pages to capture data such as Demographic data.  The intention is to have a front facing app that pre-captures required data for an end user to sign up or enroll for subscriptions\services.

In VS, set BiographicCapture.Server as the startup project.

This project utilizes version 6.14.0 of MudBlazor.
